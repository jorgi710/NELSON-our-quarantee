            Empire has acquired a distinguished reputation in education and
            serves as a training facility for Allergan (Botox, Juvederm) and
            Medicis (Restylane), along with many of the largest Aesthetic Laser
            Manufacturers. In addition, Empire is proud to have been chosen by
            the Florida Dental Association (FDA) to train their member Dentists
            in Botox Cosmetic and other Aesthetic Procedures.

            At Empire, we believe our success is dependent on you receiving
            quality training and instruction. Empire Medical Training is a
            nationally recognized CME Training Institution for Physicians,

              Empire has achieved an outstanding reputation through a
              distinguished faculty of Physician specialists. Your training will
              be conducted by Physicians and other Specialists in Aesthetics,
              Pain Management, Surgery, and Medicine. We believe it is important
              for attendees to be exposed to a faculty of instructors for a more
              complete understanding of the topic, rather than just 1 part time
              physician or nurse instructor like many training companies do.
              Beware of start up seminar companies who employ less qualified
              personnel for your training, or local doctors’ offices with
              impressive web sites looking to supplement their income by
              offering inferior or incomplete training as a side job.

              <span class="azul">Hands On</span>
            </h1>
            <p class="medium">
              Many seminar companies claim you will receive hands on training
              but they can not, or, are not qualified to provide this
              experience. During our Aesthetic Programs, Empire attendees will
              inject live patients with real, authentic products – not saline)
              and perform other procedures depending on the topic. During other
              esthetic training and our medical procedures’ training, attendees
              will work on Cadavers from the Medical School University lab along
              with volunteer patients and models.
            </p>
            <p>
              Empire works with a variety of the largest medical equipment
              manufacturers to help provide the training which requires
              equipment usage, i.e. Aesthetic Lasers and Supplies, Ultrasound, X
              Ray, etc. This variety is essential for attendees to gain a
              complete understanding of the technologies available rather than
              just a limited exposure. You will never see only 1 or 2 laser
              manufacturers at our programs. Beware of training institutions who
              have arrangements with only 1 or 2 vendors.

          Deciding on where you receive you training is an important decision
          and should be made carefully. Make sure your instructors are Physician
          Specialists in their field, i.e. Plastic Surgery and are part of a
          faculty of the institution. Simply reading some instructions is not
          enough, quality instruction means going beyond the technical details
          and into the “pearls” that make your patients happy and give you the
          reputation you want. Beware of less qualified personnel. Be sure the
          training institution is dedicated to training and not a part time
          doctors office/ seminar company. Make sure the programs are fully
          accredited by a medical academy and not “co sponsored” by another
          institution. Most importantly, beware of unrealistic promises and look
          for training that can and will provide Hands- On experience. There is
          no other effective way to learn procedural skills. Empire Medical
          Training is dedicated to your success and we encourage you to ask
          questions with whomever you decide to be trained by.
